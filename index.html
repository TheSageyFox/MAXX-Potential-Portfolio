				<a href="https://thesageyfox.github.io/moonraven-rabbitry/">MoonRaven Rabbitry</a>
				<p>A small, responsive website designed for MoonRaven Rabbitry. Built using a mobile-first approach. The most challenging part of this build was understanding what aspects of Bootstrap to use for the Photo Gallery page.</p>

				<a href="https://thesageyfox.github.io/memory-game/">Memory Match</a>
				<p>My first project written in JavaScript and jQuery. There were several aspects of this project that were difficult, the timer and move counter to name two. The most difficult aspect of this project was figuring out how to map the array of cards to produce the deck without hardcoding it in HTML.</p>

				<a href="https://thesageyfox.github.io/fend-frogger/">FEND Frogger</a>
				<p>My second major JavaScript/jQuery project and by far my most difficult. The hardest part of the coding for this project was linked to the positioning of the sprite and removing the ability for the sprite to travel out of the playing area.</p>

			<div class="text">
				<a href="https://thesageyfox.github.io/st-johns/">St. John's UCC</a>	
				<p>A mobile landing page design for St. John's UCC located in Richmond, Virginia. A project I challenged myself to do in order to explore a clean, minimalistic design that was easy to use for an elderly congregation.</p>
