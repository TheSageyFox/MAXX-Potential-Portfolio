				<h1>Earth Mage - Introduction </h1>
		<p>The grass was cool and covered in dew, from the east a soft breeze carried the scent of freshly cut grass and clover from the hay fields. Curious eyes blinked open eager to take in the view around them. One emerald green eye and one sapphire blue squinted, then blinked again as if trying to rid something from their sight. Brilliant rivers of light flowed through everything around the child ebbing and flowing with the pulse of the planet. Riven whimpered in discomfort as he pulled himself into a sitting position. His long, scruffy platinum white hair was plastered to his head and body, wet from the birthing fluids of his mother who lay a few feet away unconscious. His entry into this world had been hard on her, he didn’t blame her for needing to rest now, after all she was only a mortal. 
		</p>
		<p>The rainbow hues of magick flowed around the child as he sat patiently on the grass, waiting for his mother to awaken. He quietly watched a deer as it carefully picked out its path into the meadow. Though he carried with him all of the knowledge of the universe, this was the first time many of the mortal’s words were put to an emotion. He was fixed on not only the invisible magick flow that moved within the deer but also the more physical traits. 
		</p>
		<p>Nearly everything about the deer amused him with the innocent awe of a child. The sound of its hooves on the slick grass, its soft breath, the tension in its muscles as it moved, the color and visible texture of its fur. Everything about this world was so new and different yet so old and familiar at the same time.
		</p>
		<p>A rustling noise close to the edge of the forest startled the deer and sent it running across the meadow, it dipped out of sight for a moment into a valley. As the creature started up the other side of the valley the report of a single shot rang out in the meadow and the deer dropped to the ground. 
		</p>
		<p>Riven watched in sad wonder as the energies around the deer slowly melded into the earth in a brilliant show of greens and blues. A fierce need to protect the creature surged up within his body as a man wearing a faded duster and bush hat exited the wood near the deer. He glared at the man angrily for daring to take the life of one of his kin without permission. I don’t like you, he thought bitterly, his tiny mouth drawing down into a deep frown. 
		</p>
		<p>His attention shifted from the man to a pair of red fox kits that tumbled from the brush, it was clear that they were the source of noise that frightened the deer to its death. A smile touched Riven’s lips as he watched the kits playing with each other. For a slight moment he was jealous that he did not have someone to play with as well. Even though he knew his body was too frail in its current condition to join the foxes in their play, he still longed to be with them. 
		</p>
		<p>A sharp barking sound from the woods called the kits to attention, they nipped at each other’s tails, dancing about on their silent paws before disappearing into the underbrush after a second sharp bark emanated from the woods.
		</p> 
		<p>The was an unpleasant rumbling in his tiny stomach that caused him to whimper again, then crawl a bit towards his unconscious mother. He stared intently at her, willing the woman to wake. While his knowledge of this mortal world was not what is was before he came to be, he still knew a little of it. This unpleasant feeling that was nagging at his patience was hunger, though why he needed to feed was puzzling. The woman still hadn’t woken, and now the tiny being was beginning to become upset. He pulled himself into an erect and haughty stance by his mother’s stomach and gave her a hard shove. When that didn’t work, he plopped himself down onto the wet grass and began to scream for all his little lungs were worth. 
		</p>
		<p>That did the trick. 
		</p>
		<p>Within a few moments, Riven was resting comfortably against his mother’s chest happily suckling at her breast while being coddled and fussed over.  As the discomfort in the being’s stomach began to dissipate, he was filled with a rather charitable feeling. His mother was doing a good job taking care of his needs already, despite her other short-comings in Riven’s eyes. He cooed happily at her, his eyelids grew heavy as another new experience robbing him of complete control of himself, sleep. In his last waking moments, Riven pulled the healing magicks up from the planet and tenderly wrapped them around his mother. If he was to be cared for until he was able to do more for himself, he needed to keep her around, at least for the time being.
